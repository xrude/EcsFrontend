# EcsFrontend

**GitHub**: https://github.com/xrude/EcsFrontend

You can also extract the EcsFrontend File. You will get a screenshot folder in which I have taken screenshots and recorded the video of the same.

For running the file in the local system

 1. Install Node Js  
 2. Then run the command  *npm install express * 
 3. After that *npm i request* 
 4. Then run the "App.js" file by the command *node
    app.js*
 5. Then on Google Chrome(or any other browser) search for *localhost:3000/search*
